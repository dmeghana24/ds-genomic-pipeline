# üß¨ DS-AML Multi-Omics Analysis Pipeline

A fully reproducible, modular pipeline for integrative analysis of genome, transcriptome, and epigenome data in Down syndrome‚Äìassociated acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AML) and related genetic disorders.

---

## üåü Overview

This repository provides an end-to-end workflow for analyzing and integrating whole-genome sequencing (WGS), RNA-seq, and (optionally) methylation or ATAC-seq data. The pipeline implements state-of-the-art tools for variant calling, expression analysis, gene fusion detection, and methylation profiling, followed by integrative analysis and network/pathway exploration.  
*While inspired by Ma et al. (Nature Genetics 2023), this pipeline is uniquely extensible to any syndrome-associated malignancy or rare disease.*

---

## üö© Motivation

Down syndrome‚Äìassociated malignancies such as DS-AML exhibit unique genetic and epigenetic dysregulation. Integrative multi-omics analysis enables the discovery of regulatory networks and mutational drivers that traditional single-omics approaches may miss.  
This pipeline is designed to be flexible, reproducible, and easy to adapt for any rare disease or pediatric cancer genomics project.
